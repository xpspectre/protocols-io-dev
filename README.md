# protocols.io API Python Client

Dev/testing Python client for protocols.io API. Used Python 3.11. Set up a virtualenv in the usual way.

Make an account at protocols.io and set up API access at https://www.protocols.io/developers. Create a new API client and use the CLIENT ACCESS WITHOUT OAUTH client access token at the bottom. In the example code in `protocols_io_dev/main.py`, this assumes you put just it in a file called `.creds` in the root of this repo (it's excluded from the git files).

See `protocols_io_dev/main.py` for simple example access.
